/**
 * A base class to help with managing disposal. Creates a disposeEmitter that will be fired when disposing. This occurs
 * AFTER all prototype dispose() methods have been called up the hierarchy, so be aware of potential disposal order
 * issues if using disposeEmitter and dispose() logic together.
 *
 * This class also includes a public flag set to true when disposed.
 *
 * You can also opt into asserting out when disposing, preventing disposal on your class, see Disposable.isDisposable
